* What's This?

This is an Emacs Lisp package that implements the same functionality as Gilles Castel's [[https://github.com/gillescastel/inkscape-figures][Inkscape figure manager]]. It is designed to be more convenient for Emacs users, making use of the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minibuffer.html][minibuffer]] for selecting figures, rather than an external menu such as [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]], [[https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/choose][choose]], or [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][dmenu]].

* Usage

Download ~figedit.el~ to a place on your filesystem, then add the following to your init file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/figedit.el")
(require 'figedit)
#+end_src

Or with ~use-package~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package figedit :load-path "/path/to/figedit.el")
#+end_src

Alternatively, users of ~straight.el~ can tell straight to pull the Figedit repository from GitHub:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package figedit
  :straight (figedit :type git
                     :host github
                     :repo "olnw/figedit"))
#+end_src

Figedit can be customized by running ~M-x customize-group RET figedit RET~.
